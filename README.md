Operating Systems First Project

This project is about student records management.

We implemented a Hash Table, with Chained Lists, to hold our student records, according to a Hash Function key.

Also, we implemented an Inverted Index Table, with each "bucket" of the table, containing a reference(!) to a student stored in our aforementioned Hash Table.

The 9th option of our program, regarding the viewing of the "rankth" most popular ZipCode, is the only option in need of debugging, as it has an issue with duplicate "bests".
Nevertheless it returns, correct result, except for when we have equally best results.
